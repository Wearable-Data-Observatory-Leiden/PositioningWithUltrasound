This test consists of two files: a Python file and an Arduino file.

test2New.ino (Arduino)
Waits for an input to trigger sensor 1.
Only one sensor can be connected at a time.
test2.py (Python)
Uploads the Arduino file to the Arduino device.
Collects the measured distances from both sensors and keeps the data separate.
