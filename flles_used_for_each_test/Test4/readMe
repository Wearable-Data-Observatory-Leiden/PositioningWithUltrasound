This test consists of three files: two Arduino files and one Python file.

2sensors.ino (Arduino - Beacons)
Triggers a sensor based on the incoming input.
If input is 1, sensor 1 is triggered; if input is 2, sensor 2 is triggered.

6sensors.ino (Arduino - Tag)
Works similarly to 2sensors.ino but for six sensors.
Each input from 1 to 6 triggers a corresponding sensor.

trigger_all_sensors_calibration.py (Python)
Uploads the Arduino files to the devices.
Sends inputs to the Arduinos for sensor triggering.
First, the beacons are initialized with a specific triggering sequence.
After the beacons are set up, the tag is triggered (though tag triggering is not required for this test).
